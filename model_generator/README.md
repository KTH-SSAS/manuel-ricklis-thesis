# Attack Graph Generator
The generator utilizes a greatly simplified version of the assets and attack steps found on coreLang. coreLang is a probabilistic modeling and simulation language for the abstract domain of IT. More specifically, it is a domain specific language (DSL) created with [MAL (the Meta Attack Language)](https://mal-lang.org/).
